Install Sarus
=============

You can quickly install Sarus by following the simple steps below.

1. Download the latest standalone Sarus archive from the official `GitHub Releases <https://github.com/eth-cscs/sarus/releases>`_:

   .. code-block:: bash

       mkdir /opt/sarus
       cd /opt/sarus
       # Adjust url to your preferred version
       wget https://github.com/eth-cscs/sarus/releases/download/1.0.1/sarus-Release.tar.gz

2. Extract Sarus in the installation directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd /opt/sarus
       tar xf sarus-Release.tar.gz

3. Run the :ref:`configuration script <configure-installation-script>` to
   finalize the installation of Sarus:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd /opt/sarus/1.0.1-Release  # adapt folder name to actual version of Sarus
       sudo ./configure_installation.sh

   .. important::
       The configuration script needs to run with root privileges in order to
       set Sarus as a root-owned SUID program.

       The configuration script requires the program ``mksquashfs`` to be installed
       on the system, which is typically available through the ``squashfs-tools`` package.

       Also note that the configuration script will create a minimal working configuration.
       For enabling additional features, please refer to the :doc:`/config/configuration_reference`.

   .. note::
       You can refer to the section :doc:`Custom installation </install/index>`
       if you want to build Sarus from source or from the Spack package manager.

   .. important::
      As explained by the output of the previous script, you need to persistently add Sarus to your
      ``PATH``. I.e., something like adding "export PATH=/opt/sarus/bin:${PATH}" to your ``.bashrc``.

4. Perform the :doc:`/install/post-installation`.

   .. note::
      The Sarus binary from the standalone archive looks for SSL certificates
      into the ``/etc/ssl`` directory. Depending on the Linux distribution,
      some certificates may be located in different directories. A possible
      solution to expose the certificates to Sarus is a symlink. For example,
      on CentOS 7 and Fedora 31::

          sudo ln -s /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem /etc/ssl/cert.pem
