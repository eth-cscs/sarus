*********************************
Configuring Sarus for OCI hooks
*********************************

In order to extend the core functionality provided by a container runtime, the
OCI Runtime Specification allows for components to be hooked into the
container's lifecycle, performing custom actions. These `OCI hooks
<https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/config.md#posix-platform-hooks>`_
are especially amenable to HPC use cases, where the dedicated hardware and
highly-tuned software adopted by high-performance systems are in contrast with
the platform-agnostic nature of software containers. Effectively, OCI hooks
provide solutions for the container runtime to allow access to system-specific
features and specialized resources within container instances.

To enable the use of hooks in Sarus, the :ref:`hooksDir <config-reference-hooksDir>` directory specified
in *sarus.json* must be populated with `OCI hook JSON configuration files
<https://github.com/containers/libpod/blob/master/pkg/hooks/docs/oci-hooks.5.md>`_.
Sarus currently supports the OCI hook schema version 1.0.0.

Sarus parses the JSON files in :ref:`hooksDir <config-reference-hooksDir>` (subdirectories excluded) and,
if the ``when`` conditions specified in the JSON are all true, the OCI hook is inserted into the
OCI bundle's configuration file that is generated by Sarus.

The hooks will effectively be called by the OCI-compliant runtime specified with the
``runcPath`` parameter in *sarus.json*.

The hooks are inserted into the OCI bundle's configuration file and executed by the OCI-compliant runtime in
the order obtained by sorting the JSON file names.

All the hooks configured in the :ref:`hooksDir <config-reference-hooksDir>` directory must
satisfy the :ref:`security requirements <post-installation-permissions-security>` for critical
files and directories.
